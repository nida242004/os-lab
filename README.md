# OS Lab Simulations

Welcome to the OS Lab project repository. This document outlines the different simulations and tasks implemented in this project.

## Simulations

### 3. Simulations
- **3a:** Implement various OS simulations.
- **3b:** Parent should create a child process.
- **3c:** Both parent and child processes should display their PIDs, and the parent process should display its child's PID.
- **3d:** Demonstrate file manipulation system calls.
- **3e:** Read from and write to another file.

### 5. Process Management
- **5a:** Parent process creates a child process.
- **5b:** Both parent and child processes display their PIDs and the parent's PID. The parent process displays its child's PID.
- **5c:** Implement system calls for file manipulation.
- **5d:** Implement reading from and writing to another file.

### 6. Producer-Consumer Problem
- **6a:** Implement a producer-consumer problem with synchronization mechanisms.
- **6b:** Use shared memory to store and display `n` odd numbers.

### 7. Shared Memory Simulations
- **7a:** Compute Fibonacci numbers using shared memory.
- **7b:** Find and store a range of prime numbers using shared memory.

### 8. Multithreading
- **8a:** Use two threads to compute the sum and product of a set of numbers.

### 9. Scheduling Algorithms
- **9:** Implement First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm.
- **10:** Implement Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm.
- **11:** Implement Priority scheduling algorithm.
- **12:** Implement Round Robin scheduling algorithm.

### 12. Advanced Synchronization
- **12a:** Advanced producer-consumer simulation with enhanced synchronization techniques.
- **12b:** Implement the readers-writers problem using synchronization mechanisms.

## Build and Run Instructions

1. **Compilation:**
   To compile the programs, use the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc -o <source_file>.c -pthread
